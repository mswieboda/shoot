## Installation

[install SFML](https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml#install-sfml)

```
shards install
```

### Windows

if compiling/installing from Windows, please clone [`crsfml`](https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml)
in the same directory you have this repo, so:

```
C:\some_dir\code
C:\some_dir\code\crsfml
C:\some_dir\code\shoot

```

because for Windows, `shards install` the `make` part doesn't execute correctly, so I am requiring
`crsfml` relatively for windows, instead of the normal shard usage.

## Usage

```
make
```

for release

```
make release
```
